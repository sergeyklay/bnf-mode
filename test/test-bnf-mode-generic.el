;;; Commentary:

;; Define test-suites to test common stuff of `bnf-mode' using `buttercup'.

;;; Code:

(require 'buttercup)

(when (require 'undercover nil t)
  ;; Track coverage, but don't send to coverage serivice.  Save in parent
  ;; directory as undercover saves paths relative to the repository root.
  (undercover "*.el" "test/utils.el"
              (:report-file "coverage-final.json")
              (:send-report nil)))

(let* ((current-dir (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)
                                             default-directory))))
  (load (concat current-dir "utils.el") nil 'nomessage 'nosuffix))
