;;; Commentary:

;;   GNU Emacs major mode for editing BNF grammars.  Currently this mode
;; provides basic syntax and font-locking for BNF files.  BNF notation is
;; supported exactly form as it was first announced in the ALGOL 60 report.
;;
;; When developing this mode, the following documents were taken into account:
;;
;; - RFC822: Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt')
;; - RFC5234: Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5234.txt')
;; - FRC7405: Case-Sensitive String Support in ABNF
;;   (see URL `https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7405.txt')
;; - Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60
;;   (see URL `https://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm')
;;
;; Usage:  Put this file in your Emacs Lisp path (eg. site-lisp) and add to
;; your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'bnf-mode)
;;
;; Bugs: Bug tracking is currently handled using the GitHub issue tracker
;; (see URL `https://github.com/sergeyklay/bnf-mode/issues')
;;
;; History: History is tracked in the Git repository rather than in this file.
