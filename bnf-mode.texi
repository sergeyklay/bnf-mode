@chapter Introduction

BNF Mode is a GNU Emacs major mode for editing BNF grammars.
Presently it provides basic syntax and font-locking for BNF files.
BNF notation is supported exactly form as it was first announced in
the ALGOL 60 report.

Bellow canonical BNF notation represented with a BNF is presented.  The syntax of the BNF has been carefully copied from Revised ALGOL 60 report.  For more see @url{http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm}.

@example
<syntax>         ::= <rule> | <rule> <syntax>
<rule>           ::= <opt-ws> < <rule-name> > <opt-ws>
                     ::= <opt-ws> <expression> <line-end>
<opt-ws>         ::= <space> <opt-ws> | <empty>
<expression>     ::= <list> | <list> <opt-ws> <or> <opt-ws>
                     <expression>
<line-end>       ::= <opt-ws> <EOL> | <line-end> <line-end>
<list>           ::= <term> | <term> <opt-ws> <list>
<term>           ::= <literal> | < <rule-name> >
<literal>        ::= <character> <text>
<character>      ::= <letter> | <digit> | <symbol>
<letter>         ::= A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L |
                     M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X |
                     Y | Z | a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j |
                     k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v |
                     w | x | y | z
<digit>          ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
<symbol>         ::= <or>  | <space>   | ! | # | $ | % | & | ( | ) |
                     * | + | @comma{} | - | . | / | : | ~ | > | = | < | ? |
                     @atchar{} | [ | @backslashchar{} | ] | ^ | _ | ` | ' | " | @{ | @} | ;
<rule-name>      ::= <letter> | <rule-name> <rule-char>
<rule-char>      ::= <letter> | <digit> | -
<space>          ::= <space, tab or new line character>

@cindex Installation

The current version of BNF Mode known to work with GNU Emacs 27.1 and
later.  It may still function with older versions of Emacs, or with
other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs) but this is @i{not} guaranteed.
Bug reports for problems related to using this version of BNF Mode
with older versions of Emacs will most like not be addressed.

@node Installing from Elpa or Melpa
@section Installing from Elpa or Melpa

BNF Mode is available from Elpa, Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you
haven't used Emacs' package manager before, then it is high time you
familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs
manual, see @ref{Packages,,,emacs,}.  Then add one of the archives to
@code{package-archives}:

@cindex Elpa, installation
@itemize
@item
To use Elpa:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(package-initialize)
@end lisp

@cindex Melpa, installation
@itemize
@item
For those who want only formal, tagged releases use Melpa Stable:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
For those who want rolling releases as they happen use Melpa:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
@end lisp

Melpa tracks BNF Mode's Git repository and updates relatively soon
after each commit or formal release.  For more detail on setting up
see @uref{https://melpa.org/#/getting-started, MELPA Getting Started}.

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using @kbd{M-x} @code{package-refresh-contents}
@kbd{RET}.  Finally, use @kbd{M-x} @code{package-list-packages}
@kbd{RET} to get to the package listing and install @code{bnf-mode}
from there.

There are several ways to install @code{bnf-mode} after package
initialization:

@itemize
@item
You can install @code{bnf-mode} manually by adding following to your
init file:
@end itemize

@lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'bnf-mode)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'bnf-mode))
@end lisp

@cindex Cask, installation
@itemize
@item
To use @uref{https://cask.github.io/, Cask} add following to your
@code{Cask} file:
@end itemize

@lisp
(source melpa)
(depends-on "bnf-mode")
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
To install @code{bnf-mode} using @code{use-package} add following to
your init file:
@end itemize

@lisp
(use-package bnf-mode
  :ensure t
  ;; To use MELPA Stable use ":pin mepla-stable",
  ;; to use ELPA remove ":pin" line
  :pin melpa
  :mode "\\.bnf\\'")
@end lisp

@node Installing using El-get
@section Installing using El-get

If you use el-get, just create a recipe file @code{bnf.rcp}:

@lisp
(:name bnf-mode
 :website "https://github.com/sergeyklay/bnf-mode"
 :description "BNF Mode: A major mode for editing BNF grammars"
 :type github
 :pkgname "sergeyklay/bnf-mode")
@end lisp

Then add it to a directory present in @code{el-get-recipe-path}.
Then, use @kbd{M-x} @code{el-get-install} @kbd{RET} @code{bnf-mode}
@kbd{RET} or add to your init file:

@lisp
(el-get-bundle bnf-mode)
@end lisp

@node Installing from the Git Repository
@section Installing from the Git Repository

BNF Mode depends only on the @code{cl-lib}, which is bundled with GNU
Emacs.  Thus you don't have to install any additional library to
satisfy BNF Mode dependencies.  Below are simple steps to install BNF
Mode using manual approach:

Clone the BNF Mode repository:

@example
$ git clone https://github.com/sergeyklay/bnf-mode.git \
  ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/bnf-mode
@end example

Add this to your init file:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/bnf-mode")
@end lisp

Add @i{either} of the two following lines to your initialization file.
The first only loads BNF Mode when necessary, the 2nd always during
startup of GNU Emacs:

@lisp
(autoload 'bnf-mode "bnf-mode" nil t)
;; OR
(require 'bnf-mode)
@end lisp

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

By default any file that matches the glob @code{*.bnf} is
automatically opened in @code{bnf-mode}.  To toggle the mode in the
current buffer use @kbd{M-x} @code{bnf-mode} @kbd{RET}.

@node Customizing
@chapter Customizing

@cindex Customizing

There are not so much customization options yet.

To customize @code{abbrev-mode} for @code{bnf-mode}, simple add preffered
abbreviations to @code{bnf-mode-abbrev-table}.

If you want, you can go without any customizations at all. The above
settings are the most bang for the buck in terms of customization.  So
users that typically don't like customize a lot are advised to look at
these settings first.  To customize BNF Mode options using textual GUI
system, use the following command: @kbd{M-x} @code{customize-group}
@kbd{RET} @code{bnf} @kbd{RET}.
